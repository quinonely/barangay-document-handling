# Barangay Document Handling System
A website that handles all documents. Programmed with PHP, mySQL and JavaScript. <br>
Please check the SQL, some of the directories are not posted here for personal purposes. <br>
Change the database details accordingly. <br>
Create folders "img/", "files/", "docx/" for images and documents respectively. Check the codes for more information. <br>
Do not forget to also install Composer, a dependency manager for PHP. This is used for downloading .docx and .xlsx files respectively. <br>
<br>

This was tested in localhost (XAMPP). <br>
